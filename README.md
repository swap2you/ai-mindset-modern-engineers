# AI Mindset for Modern Engineers

A 52-week learning journey exploring how modern engineers can develop an AI-augmented mindset, improve systems thinking, and enhance their career trajectory.

## What This Repository Is

This is a **teaching, learning, and reference repository** that supports a LinkedIn + YouTube content series. It provides:

- Structured weekly learning modules
- Practical exercises and reflection prompts
- Cursor-specific prompts for hands-on learning
- Templates for creating your own content
- A clear navigation system for finding topics quickly

## What This Repository Is NOT

- **Not a framework or library** - This is educational content
- **Not a complete course** - Each week is self-contained and can be consumed independently
- **Not a replacement for hands-on practice** - Use this as a guide, then build your own projects

## Who This Repository Is For

- Engineers transitioning to AI-augmented workflows
- Developers learning to think in systems and patterns
- Professionals seeking to improve their testing and automation mindset
- Engineers interested in career growth and leadership principles

## How Weeks Are Structured

Each week module contains:

1. **README.md** - Overview and navigation
2. **01-summary.md** - Core concepts and key takeaways
3. **02-exercises.md** - Thinking exercises and practical tasks
4. **03-prompts-cursor.md** - Cursor-specific prompts for hands-on learning
5. **04-linkedin.md** - LinkedIn post content
6. **05-youtube.md** - YouTube video description and notes
7. **demo/** - Optional minimal demo code (when needed)

## How This Repository Supports LinkedIn + YouTube

- **LinkedIn Posts**: Each week includes a LinkedIn post template with key insights and a call-to-action linking back to the GitHub repository
- **YouTube Videos**: Each week includes a YouTube description template with timestamps and links to relevant repository sections
- **Cross-Platform Navigation**: Clear links between platforms make it easy for learners to find related content

## Getting Started

1. Read [START_HERE.md](./START_HERE.md) for step-by-step instructions
2. Review the [INDEX.md](./02-index/INDEX.md) to see all available topics

## Philosophy

This repository follows a **documentation-first** approach:

- **Markdown-first**: All content is in readable markdown
- **Self-contained weeks**: Each week can be consumed independently
- **Minimal code**: Demo code only when it enhances understanding
- **Strong indexing**: Easy to find and reference topics
- **Teaching-focused**: Designed for learning, not production use
