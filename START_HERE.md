# Start Here

Welcome to the AI Mindset for Modern Engineers learning journey. This guide will help you navigate this repository and get the most out of each week's content.

## Step 1: Understand the Structure

This repository is organized into weekly modules. Each week is self-contained, meaning you can jump to any week that interests you. However, we recommend following the sequence for a progressive learning experience.

**Key directories:**
- `01-weeks/` - All weekly learning modules
- `02-index/` - Master index and navigation tools
- `00-templates/` - Templates you can use for your own projects

## Step 2: Use the Index

The [INDEX.md](./02-index/INDEX.md) is your primary navigation tool. It contains:

- A table of all weeks with topics, difficulty levels, and links
- Tags to filter by topic
- Quick links to specific artifacts (exercises, prompts, etc.)

**How to use it:**
1. Open `02-index/INDEX.md`
2. Find the week you want to explore
3. Click the link to jump directly to that week's folder

## Step 3: Explore a Week Module

Each week follows this structure:

```
w##-topic-name/
├── README.md              # Start here - overview and navigation
├── 01-summary.md          # Core concepts and takeaways
├── 02-exercises.md        # Hands-on exercises
├── 03-prompts-cursor.md   # Cursor prompts for practice
├── 04-linkedin.md         # LinkedIn post content
├── 05-youtube.md          # YouTube description
└── demo/                  # Optional demo code
```

**Recommended reading order:**
1. Read the week's `README.md` first
2. Review `01-summary.md` for core concepts
3. Complete `02-exercises.md` at your own pace
4. Use `03-prompts-cursor.md` with Cursor for hands-on practice
5. Check `04-linkedin.md` and `05-youtube.md` for additional context

## Step 4: Follow Exercises

Exercises are designed to be:
- **Thinking exercises**: Reflect on concepts without code
- **Practical tasks**: Small, focused coding or tooling tasks
- **Reflection prompts**: Journal or discuss your learnings

**Tips:**
- Don't rush through exercises
- Take time to reflect on each one
- Use the Cursor prompts to experiment with concepts
- There are no "right" answers - focus on understanding

## Step 5: Use Cursor with This Repository

This repository is designed to work seamlessly with Cursor. Here's how:

1. **Open the repository in Cursor**
2. **Navigate to a week's `03-prompts-cursor.md` file**
3. **Copy prompts into Cursor's chat**
4. **Experiment and learn through hands-on practice**

The prompts are designed to:
- Help you understand concepts through practice
- Refactor existing code to apply new patterns
- Explain complex topics in your own words
- Build small examples (not production code)

## Step 6: Navigate Between Weeks

Every week's README includes:
- Links back to the INDEX
- Links to related weeks (when applicable)
- Links to relevant glossary terms

**Navigation pattern:**
- Use INDEX.md to find topics
- Use week READMEs to understand context
- Use glossary for term definitions
- Use tags to find related content

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Read this file (START_HERE.md)
- [ ] Review the main [README.md](./README.md)
- [ ] Open [INDEX.md](./02-index/INDEX.md) and browse available weeks
- [ ] Explore [Week 01](./01-weeks/w01-example-ai-mindset/) as an example
- [ ] Check out the [templates](./00-templates/) if you want to create your own content
- [ ] Start with a week that interests you!

## Tips for Success

1. **Don't try to consume everything at once** - Each week is designed to be digested over time
2. **Use the index** - It's your best friend for finding topics quickly
3. **Practice with Cursor** - The prompts are there to help you learn by doing
4. **Take notes** - Use the `notes.md` template or your own system
5. **Reflect regularly** - The exercises include reflection prompts for a reason
