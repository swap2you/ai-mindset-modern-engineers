## Understanding Prompts

### Prompt 1.1: Explain [Concept]

```
I'm learning about [concept]. Can you explain:
1. What [concept] is in simple terms
2. Why it matters for modern engineering
3. A concrete example of how it's used
4. Common misconceptions about it

Please use clear, beginner-friendly language.
```

---

### Prompt 1.2: Compare [Concept A] vs [Concept B]

```
I'm trying to understand the difference between [Concept A] and [Concept B].
Can you:
1. Explain each concept clearly
2. Highlight the key differences
3. Provide examples of when to use each
4. Explain any relationship between them
```

## Refactoring Prompts

### Prompt 2.1: Apply [Pattern] to Existing Code

```
I have this code:
[Paste code snippet]

Can you help me refactor it to apply [pattern/concept]?
Please:
1. Explain what changes you're making and why
2. Show the refactored code
3. Highlight the benefits of this approach
4. Point out any trade-offs
```

---

### Prompt 2.2: Identify [Pattern] Opportunities

```
Review this code and identify where [pattern/concept] could be applied:
[Paste code snippet]

For each opportunity:
1. Explain why it's a good fit
2. Show how to apply it
3. Discuss the impact on code quality
```

---

## Exploration Prompts

### Prompt 3.1: Experiment with [Tool/Technique]

```
I want to experiment with [tool/technique] to understand how it works.
Can you:
1. Help me set up a minimal example
2. Walk me through the key features
3. Explain what's happening at each step
4. Suggest variations to try

Keep it simple - I'm learning, not building production code.
```

---

### Prompt 3.2: Build a Small Example

```
I'd like to build a small example that demonstrates [concept].
Requirements:
- Keep it minimal (under 100 lines if possible)
- Include clear comments explaining the concept
- Use simple, readable code
- Focus on the concept, not production concerns

Can you help me create this?
```

## Explanation Prompts

### Prompt 4.1: Explain in My Own Words

```
I just learned about [concept]. Can you help me verify my understanding?

I think [concept] is: [Your explanation]

Can you:
1. Confirm what I got right
2. Correct any misunderstandings
3. Fill in any gaps
4. Suggest analogies that might help me remember it
```

---

### Prompt 4.2: Teach It Back

```
I want to practice explaining [concept] to someone else.
Can you act as a learner and:
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Point out where my explanation is unclear
3. Request examples
4. Help me refine my explanation

My explanation: [Your explanation]
```

## Prompt Guidelines

- **Learning-focused**: Prompts should help understanding, not generate production code
- **Iterative**: Use prompts multiple times with variations
- **Exploratory**: Encourage experimentation and curiosity
- **Clear**: Each prompt should have a specific learning goal
- **Modifiable**: Feel free to adapt prompts to your needs

## Tips

- Start with understanding prompts before moving to refactoring
- Use exploration prompts to build confidence
- Use explanation prompts to solidify understanding
- Combine prompts - use multiple prompts in sequence
- Modify prompts to explore edge cases or variations

---

**Remember**: These prompts are for learning. Focus on understanding concepts, not generating large amounts of code.
