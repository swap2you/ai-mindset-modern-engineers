# Week Template

This is a template for creating new weekly learning modules. Copy this entire folder structure and customize it for each week.

## Structure

Each week module should contain:

- `README.md` - This file (overview and navigation)
- `01-summary.md` - Core concepts and key takeaways
- `02-exercises.md` - Thinking exercises and practical tasks
- `03-prompts-cursor.md` - Cursor-specific prompts for hands-on learning
- `04-linkedin.md` - LinkedIn post content
- `05-youtube.md` - YouTube video description and notes
- `demo/` - Optional minimal demo code (when needed)

## Navigation

Every week README should include:

- Links back to [INDEX.md](../../02-index/INDEX.md)
- Links to related weeks (when applicable)
- Links to relevant glossary terms in [GLOSSARY.md](../../02-index/GLOSSARY.md)

## Customization Instructions

1. **Rename the folder** to `w##-topic-name/` (e.g., `w02-cursor-basics/`)
2. **Update README.md** with:
   - Week number and topic
   - What this week covers
   - How to consume the content
   - Links to all week files
3. **Fill in each numbered file** with actual content
4. **Add to INDEX.md** in `02-index/`
5. **Tag appropriately** using tags from `02-index/TAGS.md`

## Example Week Structure

```
w##-topic-name/
├── README.md              # Overview: "This week we explore..."
├── 01-summary.md          # Key concepts, takeaways
├── 02-exercises.md        # Exercises: thinking, practical, reflection
├── 03-prompts-cursor.md   # Cursor prompts for practice
├── 04-linkedin.md         # LinkedIn post with CTA
├── 05-youtube.md          # YouTube description with timestamps
└── demo/                  # Optional: minimal demo code
    └── README.md          # Explains when/why demo code exists
```

## Content Guidelines

- **Keep it concise** - Each file should be focused and readable
- **Be practical** - Focus on actionable insights
- **Link generously** - Connect to related weeks and glossary
- **No lorem ipsum** - Use real, meaningful content
- **Teaching-first** - Explain concepts clearly
