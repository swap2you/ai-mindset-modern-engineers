## Exercise Guidelines

- **Progressive difficulty**: Start simple, build complexity
- **Clear objectives**: Each exercise should have a clear learning goal
- **Time estimates**: Help learners plan their study time
- **Reflection prompts**: Encourage deeper understanding
- **No "right" answers**: Focus on understanding, not correctness
- **Optional extensions**: Include "if you want to go further" suggestions

## Tips for Learners

- Don't rush through exercises
- Take time to reflect after each one
- Use the Cursor prompts (`03-prompts-cursor.md`) to experiment
- Discuss your findings with others if possible
- Revisit exercises after a few days to reinforce learning
