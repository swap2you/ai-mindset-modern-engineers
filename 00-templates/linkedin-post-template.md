## Content Guidelines

- **Lead with value**: What will they learn or gain?
- **Use examples**: Concrete examples resonate better
- **Include CTA**: Always link back to GitHub
- **Engage**: Ask questions to encourage comments
- **Professional tone**: Calm, teaching-focused, no hype

## Best Practices

- Post at optimal times (typically Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM)
- Include relevant hashtags (3-5 is ideal)
- Respond to comments promptly
- Cross-reference with YouTube video when available
- Use visuals when possible (diagrams, code snippets)

## GitHub Link Format

Always link to the specific week:
```
https://github.com/[username]/ai-mindset-modern-engineers/tree/main/01-weeks/w##-topic-name
```

Or link to specific files:
```
