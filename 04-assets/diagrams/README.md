# Diagrams Directory

This directory will contain diagrams, flowcharts, and visual aids used in content.

## Purpose

Diagrams for:
- Explaining concepts visually
- System architecture diagrams
- Process flowcharts
- Mind maps
- Comparison visuals

## Guidelines

- Use clear, readable diagrams
- Maintain consistent style
- Include source files when possible (e.g., `.drawio`, `.fig`)
- Export to common formats (PNG, SVG) for easy use
- Name files descriptively (e.g., `problem-first-vs-code-first.png`)

## Current Status

This directory is currently empty. Diagrams will be added as content is created.
