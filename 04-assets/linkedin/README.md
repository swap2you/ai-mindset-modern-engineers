# LinkedIn Assets Directory

This directory contains LinkedIn post assets organized by week.

## Structure

```
linkedin/
├── README.md           # This file
├── week-01/            # Week 01 LinkedIn assets
│   ├── post-1.png
│   ├── post-2.png
│   └── document.pdf
├── week-02/            # Week 02 LinkedIn assets (when available)
└── ...
```

## Guidelines

- **PNG/JPG files**: Image posts, carousel slides, graphics
- **PDF files**: Documents, guides, or downloadable resources
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `carousel-slide-1.png`, `guide.pdf`)
- **Organization**: One folder per week following the pattern `week-##`

## Linking from Week Modules

Week modules reference these assets in their `04-linkedin.md` files:

```markdown
![Post Image](../../04-assets/linkedin/week-01/post-1.png)
[Download Guide](../../04-assets/linkedin/week-01/guide.pdf)
```

## Current Status

This directory is organized by week as LinkedIn assets are created.
