# 52-Week Learning Roadmap

This document outlines the philosophy and structure of the 52-week AI Mindset for Modern Engineers learning journey.

## Philosophy

This roadmap is designed as a **progressive learning path** that builds foundational concepts before moving to advanced topics. Each week is self-contained, but the sequence is intentional:

1. **Foundation weeks** establish core concepts
2. **Intermediate weeks** build on foundations with practical applications
3. **Advanced weeks** explore complex patterns and real-world scenarios
4. **Integration weeks** tie concepts together

## Learning Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-12)
**Focus**: Core AI mindset, basic tooling, fundamental concepts

- Understanding AI-augmented engineering
- Introduction to modern development tools
- Basic systems thinking
- Testing fundamentals
- Version control and collaboration

**Example topics:**
- AI Mindset for Modern Engineers (Week 01)
- Introduction to Cursor and AI-assisted development
- Systems thinking basics
- Test-driven development foundations

### Phase 2: Systems Thinking (Weeks 13-24)
**Focus**: Architecture, patterns, and design principles

- Design patterns and anti-patterns
- System architecture fundamentals
- Code organization and modularity
- API design and integration
- Performance and scalability thinking

**Example topics:**
- Microservices vs monoliths: when and why
- Event-driven architecture patterns
- Database design principles
- Caching strategies

### Phase 3: Testing & Automation (Weeks 25-36)
**Focus**: Quality assurance, automation, and reliability

- Advanced testing strategies
- CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure as code
- Monitoring and observability
- Error handling and resilience

**Example topics:**
- Contract testing and API contracts
- End-to-end testing strategies
- Infrastructure automation
- Observability patterns

### Phase 4: AI-Augmented Engineering (Weeks 37-44)
**Focus**: Deep integration of AI tools and workflows

- Advanced AI tooling workflows
- Code generation and review
- Documentation automation
- AI-assisted debugging
- Prompt engineering for developers

**Example topics:**
- Building AI-assisted development workflows
- Code review automation
- Documentation generation
- AI-powered testing strategies

### Phase 5: Career & Leadership Mindset (Weeks 45-52)
**Focus**: Professional growth, communication, and leadership

- Technical communication
- Mentoring and knowledge sharing
- Architecture decision-making
- Career progression strategies
- Building engineering culture

**Example topics:**
- Writing effective technical documentation
- Leading technical discussions
- Career growth for engineers
- Building inclusive engineering teams

## Roadmap Status

### Completed Weeks

- ✅ **Week 01**: AI Mindset for Modern Engineers (Example/Structural)

### Planned Weeks (Placeholders)

The following weeks are planned but not yet created. Each will follow the same structure as Week 01:

- 🔲 **Weeks 2-12**: Foundation phase topics
- 🔲 **Weeks 13-24**: Systems thinking phase topics
- 🔲 **Weeks 25-36**: Testing & automation phase topics
- 🔲 **Weeks 37-44**: AI-augmented engineering phase topics
- 🔲 **Weeks 45-52**: Career & leadership phase topics

## How Weeks Are Added

Each new week will:

1. Follow the template structure in `00-templates/week-template/`
2. Be added to `01-weeks/` with naming convention `w##-topic-name/`
3. Be indexed in `02-index/INDEX.md`
4. Include appropriate tags from `02-index/TAGS.md`
5. Link back to INDEX and related weeks

## Customization

This roadmap is a guide, not a strict requirement. Feel free to:

- Jump to weeks that interest you
- Skip weeks that don't apply to your situation
- Use weeks as reference material
- Create your own learning path using the templates

## Future Considerations

As the series progresses, we may:

- Add bonus weeks for emerging topics
- Create integration weeks that combine multiple concepts
- Develop advanced tracks for specific domains
- Add case studies and real-world examples

## Contributing to the Roadmap

Suggestions for future weeks are welcome. Consider:

- Topics that build on existing weeks
- Gaps in the current progression
- Real-world scenarios that need coverage
- Tools and technologies that emerge

---

**Current Status**: Week 01 is available as an example. Future weeks will be added progressively.

**Next Steps**: Explore [Week 01](./01-weeks/w01-example-ai-mindset/) to see the structure, then check the [INDEX](./02-index/INDEX.md) as new weeks are added.
