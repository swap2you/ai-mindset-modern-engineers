# Tagging System

This document defines the tagging system used throughout the repository for organizing and filtering content.

## Tag Philosophy

Tags should be:
- **Small and consistent**: Use a limited set of well-defined tags
- **Hierarchical when helpful**: Use broad categories with specific sub-tags
- **Searchable**: Tags should make it easy to find related content
- **Maintainable**: Don't create new tags without good reason

## Core Tag Categories

### Mindset & Philosophy
- `mindset` - General mindset and thinking patterns
- `philosophy` - Engineering philosophy and principles
- `career` - Career development and growth
- `leadership` - Leadership and team dynamics

### AI & Tools
- `ai-basics` - Fundamental AI concepts for engineers
- `ai-advanced` - Advanced AI tooling and workflows
- `cursor` - Cursor-specific content
- `tooling` - Development tools and workflows
- `automation` - Automation strategies and patterns

### Engineering Practices
- `testing` - Testing strategies and practices
- `tdd` - Test-driven development
- `refactoring` - Code refactoring techniques
- `code-quality` - Code quality and maintainability
- `documentation` - Documentation practices

### Systems & Architecture
- `architecture` - System architecture and design
- `systems-thinking` - Systems thinking principles
- `patterns` - Design patterns and anti-patterns
- `microservices` - Microservices architecture
- `api-design` - API design principles

### Foundation
- `foundation` - Foundational concepts for beginners
- `intermediate` - Intermediate-level topics
- `advanced` - Advanced topics requiring prior knowledge

### Domains
- `backend` - Backend development topics
- `frontend` - Frontend development topics
- `fullstack` - Full-stack development topics
- `devops` - DevOps and infrastructure topics

## Tag Usage Rules

1. **Use 2-4 tags per week** - Don't over-tag
2. **Prefer existing tags** - Check this list before creating new tags
3. **Be specific** - Use the most specific tag that applies
4. **Combine categories** - A week can have tags from multiple categories

## Tag Examples

**Week 01: AI Mindset for Modern Engineers**
- `mindset` - It's about mindset shift
- `ai-basics` - Fundamental AI concepts
- `foundation` - Suitable for beginners

**Example: Testing Week**
- `testing` - Core topic
- `tdd` - Specific practice covered
- `intermediate` - Difficulty level

**Example: Architecture Week**
- `architecture` - Core topic
- `systems-thinking` - Related concept
- `advanced` - Difficulty level

## Adding New Tags

Before adding a new tag, consider:
1. Is there an existing tag that covers this?
2. Will this tag be used for multiple weeks?
3. Is it specific enough to be useful?
4. Does it fit into an existing category?

If you need a new tag:
1. Add it to this document with a brief description
2. Use it consistently going forward
3. Consider if it should replace or complement existing tags

## Tag Maintenance

- Review tags periodically for consistency
- Merge similar tags if they become redundant
- Archive unused tags (but keep them documented)
- Update this document when tags change
