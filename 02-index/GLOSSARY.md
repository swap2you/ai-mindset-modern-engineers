# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms and concepts used throughout the repository. Terms are organized by category for easy navigation.

## AI

### AI-Augmented Engineering
The practice of using AI tools to enhance and accelerate engineering work while maintaining human judgment and critical thinking.

### Problem-First Thinking
An approach to engineering that starts by clearly articulating the problem to be solved before jumping to code or solutions. Essential for effective AI assistance.

### Code-First Thinking
A traditional approach that begins with writing code to solve a problem, often before fully understanding the problem domain.

### Prompt Engineering
The practice of crafting clear, specific prompts for AI tools to get useful and accurate responses. Important for developers using AI-assisted tools.

## Testing

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
A development practice where tests are written before code, driving the design and ensuring code meets requirements.

### Unit Testing
Testing individual components or functions in isolation to verify they work correctly.

### Integration Testing
Testing how multiple components work together to ensure they integrate properly.

### Contract Testing
Testing that services or components meet their agreed-upon contracts or interfaces.

---

## Automation

### CI/CD
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment - practices for automatically building, testing, and deploying code.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes.

### Observability
The ability to understand a system's internal state by examining its outputs, including metrics, logs, and traces.

---

## Systems

### Systems Thinking
An approach to problem-solving that views problems as parts of an overall system, rather than in isolation.

### Architecture
The high-level structure and organization of a software system, including how components interact.

### Design Patterns
Reusable solutions to common problems in software design.

### Anti-Patterns
Common solutions that appear helpful but actually create more problems than they solve.

---

## Mindset

### Growth Mindset
The belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work.

### Engineering Mindset
A way of thinking that emphasizes problem-solving, systematic approaches, and continuous improvement.

### Critical Thinking
The objective analysis and evaluation of information to form a judgment, essential when working with AI tools.
