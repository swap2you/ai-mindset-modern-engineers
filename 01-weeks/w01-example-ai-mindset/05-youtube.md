## Video Title
[Week 01] AI Mindset for Modern Engineers - The Problem-First Approach

## Description

The biggest shift in modern engineering isn't learning new AI tools—it's changing how we think about problems. In this video, we explore the AI mindset for engineers and how to shift from "code-first" to "problem-first" thinking.

**What you'll learn:**
- The difference between traditional and AI-augmented engineering mindsets
- How to frame problems for effective AI assistance
- When AI tools help most (and when they don't)
- How to maintain critical thinking skills while using AI
- Practical strategies for developing an AI-augmented workflow

**Who this is for:**
- Engineers transitioning to AI-augmented workflows
- Developers learning to work with AI tools like Cursor
- Anyone interested in modern engineering practices
