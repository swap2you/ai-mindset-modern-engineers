# Week 01: LinkedIn Post Content

## Short Post Option

**Hook**: 
The biggest shift in modern engineering isn't learning new tools—it's changing how we think about problems.

**Body**:
When I first started using AI-assisted development tools, I thought they'd replace my need to understand code. I was wrong.

The real power comes from shifting from "code-first" to "problem-first" thinking. Instead of jumping straight to writing code, I now start by clearly articulating the problem I'm solving.

This mindset change makes AI tools exponentially more useful. They excel when you can frame problems clearly, but they can't replace your judgment about architecture, trade-offs, or long-term maintainability.

The engineers who thrive with AI aren't the ones who automate everything—they're the ones who learn to collaborate with AI while maintaining critical thinking skills.

- Visual: Diagram showing "Code-First" vs "Problem-First" thinking

**Slide 2**: Shift 1 - Problem-First Thinking
- Text: "Start with the problem, not the code. AI tools work best when you can clearly articulate what you're solving."
- Visual: Problem statement example

**Slide 3**: Shift 2 - AI as Collaborator
- Text: "AI augments your work, it doesn't replace your judgment. You still need to evaluate, integrate, and maintain."
- Visual: Collaboration diagram

**Slide 4**: Shift 3 - Critical Thinking
- Text: "Your critical thinking skills are more valuable than ever. AI generates code; you ensure it's right."
- Visual: Code review checklist

**Caption**:
The way we approach engineering is changing, but not in the way many people think.

It's not about replacing engineers with AI—it's about developing a new mindset that leverages AI as a collaborative partner.

In this week's guide, we explore:
✅ Problem-first vs code-first thinking
✅ When AI helps most (and when it doesn't)
✅ How to maintain critical thinking skills
✅ Practical exercises to develop the mindset
