# Week 01 Summary — AI Mindset Reset

Most engineers are approaching AI with the wrong question:

> “Will AI replace me?”

This week reframes the question to:

> “What thinking work can AI amplify for me?”

---

## Core idea
AI does not replace engineers.
AI replaces **unstructured thinking, repetition, and shallow analysis**.

Engineers who:
- delegate thinking blindly → lose skill
- reject AI emotionally → lose leverage
- treat AI as a collaborator → grow faster

---

## Mental shift required
From:
- Tool obsession
- Prompt memorization
- Fear-based narratives

To:
- Thinking frameworks
- Question quality
- Decision ownership

---

## Key takeaway
AI is not your brain.
AI is your **thinking surface**.

You stay accountable.
AI accelerates clarity.
