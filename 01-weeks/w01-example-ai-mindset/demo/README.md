# Demo Code Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains minimal demo code when it's necessary to illustrate concepts from the week's content.

## Philosophy

**This is NOT a production code repository.**

Demo code here serves one purpose: **teaching and learning**.

## When Demo Code Exists

Demo code may be included when:
- A concept is best understood through a small, runnable example
- Visual demonstration helps clarify an abstract concept
- Hands-on experimentation reinforces learning
- A template or starter code helps with exercises

## When Demo Code Doesn't Exist

Many weeks will have **no demo code at all**. This is intentional and correct.

We prioritize:
- Clear explanations
- Thoughtful exercises
- Practical prompts
- Real-world examples

Over:
- Complex codebases
- Production-ready implementations
- Full-featured applications

## Code Guidelines

When demo code is included, it will:
- Be minimal and focused
- Include clear comments explaining concepts
- Use simple, readable code
- Focus on the concept, not production concerns
- Be clearly marked as educational

## Example Structure

If demo code exists, it might look like:

```
demo/
├── README.md           # This file
├── example-1.py        # Simple example demonstrating concept
└── example-2.js        # Another example in different language
```

## For This Week

**Week 01: AI Mindset for Modern Engineers**

No demo code is needed for this week. The concepts are about mindset and thinking, not specific code patterns.

The exercises and Cursor prompts in the parent directory provide all the hands-on practice needed.

---

**Remember**: If you don't see code here, that's by design. Focus on the exercises, prompts, and reflection activities instead.
