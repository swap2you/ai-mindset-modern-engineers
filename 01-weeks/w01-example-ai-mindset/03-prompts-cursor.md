# Week 01: Cursor Prompts

These prompts are designed for use with Cursor to practice the AI mindset concepts from this week.

## How to Use

1. Open Cursor in this repository
2. Copy a prompt below into Cursor's chat
3. Experiment and learn through practice
4. Modify prompts to explore variations

## Understanding Prompts

### Prompt 1.1: Explain AI-Augmented Engineering

```
I'm learning about AI-augmented engineering. Can you explain:
1. What AI-augmented engineering means in simple terms
2. How it differs from traditional software development
3. A concrete example of how an engineer might use AI tools in their workflow
4. Common misconceptions about AI in engineering

Please use clear, beginner-friendly language and avoid marketing hype.
```

---

### Prompt 1.2: Compare Problem-First vs Code-First Thinking

```
I'm trying to understand the difference between problem-first and code-first thinking in engineering.

Can you:
1. Explain each approach clearly
2. Highlight the key differences
3. Provide examples of when each approach is appropriate
4. Explain how AI tools change which approach is more effective
```

---

## Refactoring Prompts

### Prompt 2.1: Apply Problem-First Thinking

```
I have this code that solves a problem, but I wrote it in a code-first way:
[Paste a code snippet - e.g., a function you've written]

Can you help me refactor it with a problem-first mindset?
Please:
1. First, explain what problem this code is solving
2. Then show how to approach it from a problem-first perspective
3. Refactor the code if needed
4. Explain the benefits of this approach
```

---

### Prompt 2.2: Identify AI-Assistance Opportunities

```
Review this code and identify where AI assistance could be helpful:
[Paste a code snippet]

For each opportunity:
1. Explain what AI could help with
2. Show what a good prompt would look like
3. Discuss what the engineer would still need to do manually
4. Highlight any risks or considerations
```

---

## Exploration Prompts

### Prompt 3.1: Experiment with Problem Framing

```
I want to practice framing problems for AI assistance. Let's work through an example:

Problem: I need to validate user input in a form

Can you:
1. Help me expand this into a clear problem statement that would work well with AI
2. Show me what information I should include
3. Demonstrate how to frame it as a prompt
4. Explain why each part of the framing matters
```

---

### Prompt 3.2: Build a Small Example with AI

```
I'd like to build a small example that demonstrates problem-first thinking with AI assistance.

Let's create a simple utility function together:
- Function: Validate and format a phone number
- Requirements: Accept various formats, return standardized format
- Edge cases: Handle invalid input, different country codes

Can you:
1. Help me frame this as a clear problem statement first
2. Then generate code based on that framing
3. Walk me through what's happening
4. Show me how to test it

Keep it simple - I'm learning, not building production code.
```

## Explanation Prompts

### Prompt 4.1: Verify Understanding

```
I just learned about the AI mindset for engineers. Can you help me verify my understanding?

I think the key points are:
1. [Your understanding point 1]
2. [Your understanding point 2]
3. [Your understanding point 3]

Can you:
1. Confirm what I got right
2. Correct any misunderstandings
3. Fill in any gaps
4. Suggest analogies that might help me remember it
```

---

### Prompt 4.2: Practice Critical Evaluation

```
I want to practice evaluating AI-generated code critically. 

Here's some code an AI suggested for [describe the task]:
[Paste AI-generated code]

Can you act as a mentor and:
1. Help me identify what's good about this code
2. Point out potential issues or improvements
3. Ask me questions to help me think critically about it
4. Guide me through the evaluation process
```

---

## Advanced Prompts

### Prompt 5.1: Explore Edge Cases

```
I have this function that [describe what it does]:
[Paste function code]

Can you help me:
1. Identify edge cases I should consider
2. Show me how to test those edge cases
3. Discuss which edge cases are most important
4. Explain how AI tools can help with edge case discovery (and their limitations)
```

---

### Prompt 5.2: Refactor with AI Assistance

```
I want to refactor this code to be more maintainable:
[Paste code snippet]

Can you:
1. First help me understand what "maintainable" means in this context
2. Identify specific maintainability issues in this code
3. Suggest refactorings (explain why, don't just do it)
4. Help me implement one refactoring step by step
5. Discuss what I should watch out for when using AI for refactoring
```

## Prompt Guidelines

- **Start simple**: Begin with understanding prompts before moving to refactoring
- **Be specific**: The more context you provide, the better the AI can help
- **Ask why**: Don't just accept AI suggestions - understand the reasoning
- **Iterate**: Use multiple prompts in sequence to build understanding
- **Modify**: Adapt these prompts to your specific needs and interests

## Tips

- Use understanding prompts to build foundational knowledge
- Use exploration prompts to gain confidence with AI tools
- Use explanation prompts to solidify your understanding
- Combine prompts - build on previous conversations
- Don't just copy code - understand what it does and why

---

**Remember**: These prompts are for learning. Focus on understanding concepts and developing judgment, not just generating code.

**Next**: Complete the exercises in `02-exercises.md` to reinforce these concepts.
