# Week 01 — AI Mindset Reset: From Confusion to Clarity

This module starts the 52-week **AI Mindset for Modern Engineers** series.

This week is intentionally **non-technical**.

Before learning tools, prompts, or frameworks, engineers must fix how they **think** about AI.
Without this reset, AI becomes either:
- a fear amplifier, or
- a productivity illusion
