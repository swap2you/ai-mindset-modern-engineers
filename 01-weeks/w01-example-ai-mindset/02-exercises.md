# Week 01 — Mindset Exercises

These exercises are about **thinking**, not tools.
Write answers. Do not skim.

---

## Exercise 1 — Fear inventory
Answer honestly:

- What exactly am I afraid of with AI?
- Which part is emotional vs factual?
- What skill do I fear losing?

Goal: separate fear from facts.

---

## Exercise 2 — Task decomposition
List 5 tasks you do weekly.

For each task:
- What part is *thinking*?
- What part is *execution*?
- What part is *repetition*?

AI is strongest in repetition and surface-level execution.

## Exercise 3 — Responsibility check
For one AI-assisted task, answer:
- Who owns correctness?
- Who owns decisions?
- Who owns consequences?

If your answer isn’t “me”, you’re using AI incorrectly.

---

## Exercise 4 — AI boundary definition
Write one sentence:
> “I will use AI for ______ but never for ______.”

This boundary protects your growth.

---

## Exercise 5 — Clarity test
Explain AI’s role in your work in **one calm sentence**.
No hype. No fear.

If you can’t, mindset is still fuzzy.
