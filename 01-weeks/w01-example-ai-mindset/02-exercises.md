# Week 01 Exercises: AI Mindset for Modern Engineers

These exercises help you internalize the AI mindset shift through reflection and practice.

## Section 1: Thinking Exercises

### Exercise 1.1: Problem Framing

**Objective**: Practice articulating problems clearly, which is essential for effective AI assistance.

**Time**: 10 minutes

**Instructions**:
1. Think of a recent coding task or problem you worked on
2. Write down the problem in one sentence
3. Now expand it to include:
   - What you're trying to achieve (the goal)
   - What constraints or requirements exist
   - What context is important
4. Compare your original sentence to your expanded description

**Reflection**:
- Was your original problem statement clear enough for someone (or an AI) to help you?
- What details did you add that would be important for AI assistance?
- How does clear problem framing help with both AI tools and human collaboration?

### Exercise 1.2: AI vs Traditional Methods

**Objective**: Develop judgment about when to use AI assistance vs traditional methods.

**Time**: 15 minutes

**Instructions**:
1. List 5 common engineering tasks you do regularly
2. For each task, decide:
   - Would AI assistance be helpful? (Yes/No/Maybe)
   - Why or why not?
   - What would you need to provide to get good AI assistance?
3. For tasks where AI would help, identify what you'd still need to do manually

**Example**:
- Task: Writing unit tests
- AI helpful? Yes
- Why: AI can generate test cases, but I need to verify they test the right things
- What I'd provide: Function signature, expected behavior, edge cases
- What I'd do manually: Review tests, ensure coverage, run and verify

**Reflection**:
- Are there patterns in which tasks benefit from AI?
- What makes a task suitable for AI assistance?
- How do you maintain quality when using AI-generated code?

## Section 2: Practical Tasks

### Exercise 2.1: Frame a Problem for AI

**Objective**: Practice framing a problem in a way that would work well with AI assistance.

**Time**: 15 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Access to Cursor or similar AI tool (optional - you can do this conceptually)

**Instructions**:
1. Choose a small coding task (e.g., "create a function that validates email addresses")
2. Write a problem statement that includes:
   - Clear goal
   - Input/output specifications
   - Edge cases to consider
   - Any constraints (language, style, dependencies)
3. If you have Cursor, try using your problem statement as a prompt
4. Evaluate the result: Was it helpful? What would you change about your prompt?

**Check your work**:
- Is the problem statement clear and specific?
- Does it include enough context for someone to solve it?
- Would an AI tool be able to generate useful code from it?

**Reflection**:
- What made your problem statement effective (or not)?
- How did framing it clearly change the outcome?
- What would you do differently next time?

### Exercise 2.2: Evaluate AI Suggestions

**Objective**: Practice critically evaluating AI-generated code or suggestions.

**Time**: 20 minutes

**Prerequisites**: Access to Cursor or similar AI tool

**Instructions**:
1. Ask an AI tool to help with a small coding task
2. Review the AI's suggestion and ask yourself:
   - Does it solve the problem correctly?
   - Is it readable and maintainable?
   - Does it follow best practices?
   - Are there edge cases it doesn't handle?
   - Would it fit your team's codebase?
3. Identify at least one improvement you'd make
4. Modify the AI's suggestion to incorporate your improvement

**Check your work**:
- Did you identify specific issues or improvements?
- Can you articulate why your changes are better?
- Do you understand what the code does?

**Reflection**:
- What types of issues did you find in the AI's suggestion?
- How did you decide what to change?
- What does this tell you about your role when using AI tools?

## Section 3: Reflection

### Reflection 3.1: Your Current Workflow

**Time**: 10 minutes

**Prompt**: 
Think about your current engineering workflow. How do you approach new tasks or problems? What would change if you adopted an AI-augmented mindset?

**Consider**:
- What parts of your workflow could benefit from AI assistance?
- What parts require your judgment and shouldn't be automated?
- How would you maintain quality and understanding while using AI tools?
- What concerns do you have about using AI in your work?

---

### Reflection 3.2: The Engineer's Role

**Time**: 10 minutes

**Prompt**:
As AI tools become more capable, what becomes more important about the engineer's role? What skills or mindsets become more valuable?

**Consider**:
- Problem-solving and critical thinking
- System understanding and architecture
- Communication and collaboration
- Learning and adaptation
- Quality and maintainability

## Exercise Guidelines

- **Take your time**: These exercises are about reflection and understanding, not speed
- **Be honest**: There are no "right" answers - focus on your genuine thoughts
- **Experiment**: Try the practical tasks even if you're unsure - learning comes from doing
- **Revisit**: Come back to these exercises after a few days to see if your perspective changes

## Tips for Success

- Complete exercises in order - they build on each other
- Write down your reflections - you'll want to refer back to them
- Use the Cursor prompts in `03-prompts-cursor.md` to practice hands-on
- Discuss your findings with others if possible
- Don't worry about being "right" - focus on understanding

**Next**: Try the Cursor prompts in `03-prompts-cursor.md` for hands-on practice.
